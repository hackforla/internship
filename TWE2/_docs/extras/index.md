# Extras

Extras include other integrations that aren't relevant to style or customization,
but can further enhance your documentation pages. Currently, we have support
for adding interactive quizzes.

 - [Quizzes](example-quiz)
 - [Interactive Code Blocks](interactive)

Would you like to see another question type, or another kind of extra? Please
[open an issue])({{ site.repo }}/issues/new).
