### Overview
We need to create a wiki structure and task list to support the development of a new research plan on [Replace TITLE OF RESEARCH] so that we can stay organized and consistent across all team members and working times.

**Resources/Instructions**: This section is at the bottom of this issue (scroll to the bottom to view it now). You will be asked to add links to this section while completing the issue.
