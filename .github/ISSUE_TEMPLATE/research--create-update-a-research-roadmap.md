- Compare Document Headings
    - [ ] With the roadmap document open in one tab (linked in Resources # 2.04), open in another tab the `TWE: Template: Research Roadmap` (linked in Resources # 1.03)
    - [ ] Click inside the roadmap document (linked in Resources # 2.04) and scroll through the document to determine whether the document contains the same headings as the research roadmap template (linked in Resources # 1.03).
- Adjust Incorrect Document Headings
    - [ ] If the document does not have the correct headings, then adjust the headings according to the template.
        - [ ] Check that each major heading is formatted as Header 1.
        - [ ] To check formatting, place your cursor inside the heading text and look at the Styles dropdown menu next to the Font dropdown menu. If it needs adjusted, select the entire heading text and choose "Header 1" in the Styles dropdown menu.

If they need to be adjusted, fix them according to how they are named in the Research Output Overview page (linked in Resources # 2.01) or ask the UXR lead if there is no corresponding wiki page.
     - [ ] Confirm that the research plan names are formatted as Header 2 in the document heading options.
        - [ ] To check, place your cursor inside the heading text and look at the Styles dropdown menu next to the Font dropdown menu. If it needs adjusted, select the entire heading text and choose "Header 2" in the Styles dropdown menu.
    - [ ] Confirm research plan's subsection has the following sections
        - Goals
        - Requirements
