### Dependencies  
 - [ ] The research plan's interview recordings folder has been created on Internship - PII's "My Drive"

### Overview
We need to set up a few spreadsheets and a folder for RP[Replace 000]'s [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace TYPE OF INTERVIEW] interview transcripts so that we can move on to transcribe the interviews. 

During these tasks you will be asked to add link to the Resources/Instructions section, and that section is at the bottom of this issue (go view it now).

Another tip is to use split browser windows side by side when working on any GitHub issue, so you can edit the issue on one window, and check the resources or click through links on the other window to avoid a lot of back and forth. Make sure to refresh both windows to reflect any changes you made, including updating the issue or checking the boxes on one of them.


### Action Items
- [ ] UX lead asks admin to add the team member working on this issue to the 1Password internship-UX's vault so that they can have access to internship-UX's email and other software account information in case they need it.
- [ ] UX lead adds the assignee to the Internship - PII's "My Drive" as a Content Manager so that they have access to internship - PII's My Drive where the recordings and transcriptions with PII are stored.
   - [ ] UX lead accesses the Internship - PII's "My Drive"

    - If the recording video files are not in the format above, please rename the recording files in the format above first before taking any more actions
    - An example looks like this: `RP006-U007-I001.mp4`, which means this is an interview transcript for research plan 006, conducted by UX Researcher 007, and the interviewee is Intern 001
    - In case if you would like to double check to ensure the accuracy of the interviewer and interviewees' numbers, both UX Researcher Abbreviation### and [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] Abbreviation### can be found in the `session table` tab of `TWE: IS[Replace YY]: RP[Replace 000]: [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace TYPE OF INTERVIEW] Interview Roll Call and Session Table` in RP[Replace 000] folder (linked in Resources # 2.02)

#### Review and hand off
- [ ] Review with UXR Leads on the spreadsheets, de-identified transcript folder setup, renamed recording files, and updated wiki section 
- [ ] The assignee checks in with UXR Leads to create new issues for transcribing the interview recordings if needed
- [ ] UXR Lead or PM removes the assignee from the Internship - PII's "My Drive" when closing the issue if the assignee does not need to access the Internship - PII's "My Drive" any longer
- [ ] Product sign-off
