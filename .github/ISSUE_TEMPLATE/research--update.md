### Resources/Instructions

- [RP__ Wiki Page]
- [Example Wiki Research Plan Page: RP6](https://github.com/hackforla/internship/wiki/Research-Plan-6:-Intern-Intake-Interviews)
- Don't link GitHub issues, instead make sure that the wiki page has a link to all the issues using the label (e.g., `Research: RP006` label)
- If a particular Research Plan was not conducted during the Internship 2022, note why under "Current Status".
- Tips for identifying mislabeled GitHub issues
    - In the search bar, type keywords that might be related to this research plan
    - Start broad to identify keywords that might indicate the same thing. Quickly scroll through all issues to see if the language to describe this research plan was inconsistent (e.g., "intake" vs. "onboarding"). Make sure that no matter the language that the RP label is correct.
    - Look in both open and closed issues
