### Overview
We need to test the [Replace DIRECT OBJECT] Issue Template so that researchers can start making [Replace DIRECT OBJECT] issues on/for the various research plans/tasks

#### Details
We expect that the template you are testing will need some improvement and the fact that you don't know much about the project is a benefit here, because it's likely that the person making the template can overlook something that they already know how to do, but should be fully explained in the template so that people can do the work independently.
