#### Clean up and de-identify the transcript
- [ ] Open the "To be de-identified" Google Doc transcript if it is not open yet (Resource # 2.10)
- [ ] Listen to the recording to get yourself familiar with the transcript
- [ ] Go to Resources # 1.04 to get a refresher on the cleaning up and de-identification process. **_This is particularly important if it is your first time cleaning up an interview transcript_**. 
    - [ ] No need to correct all grammatical mistakes in the transcript because the transcript needs to stay authentic
    - [ ] Check Resources # 1.04.01 to understand the conventions for cleaning up and de-identifying the transcript, so you can learn to use them properly.
    - [ ] Watch the videos in Resources # 1.04.02 as they walk you through the basics on how to clean up and de-identify the transcript so we can stay consistent in this process
    - [ ] Read Resources # 1.04.03 and 1.04.04 for more best practices to clean up and de-identify an interview transcript
    - [ ] Follow the following guidelines on the transcript formatting:
        - [ ] Use the 'in-line' format as seen [here in RP012 Intern 008's transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yE3M29L0EvjsgawxA6QTijM3diLQpviT-RSk2WgGdM4/edit?usp=sharing)
        - [ ] Use 6 digit format for all the timestamps, for example, 01:01:01 as hour one/minute one/second one
        - [ ] Use "UXR ###" and "Intern ###" throughout the transcript to indicate the interviewer and interviewee. See an example [here in RP012 Intern 008's transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yE3M29L0EvjsgawxA6QTijM3diLQpviT-RSk2WgGdM4/edit?usp=sharing).
            - If there were other people recorded on the transcript, name the unknown person based on the interview set-up or context, such as Program Manager, Notetaker, etc. If you are not sure what to name them, ask leads on the project for clarification.
        - [ ] If there are other numerical values in the transcript other than the timestamps, UXR ###, and Intern ###, transcribe them using APA formatting so we can easily scan the transcript. For example, write out numbers below ten as words ("one", "two"), and using numerical values for numbers ten and above ("10", "20"). For more info on numbers' formatting, please visit https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/numbers/numerals.

- Listen to the interview recording again and clean up the inaccuracies in the transcript as you read along because the transcripts often contain mistakes since the auto transcription is not accurate
    - [ ] Separate the texts based on speakers and timestamps (timestamps should match the video file timestamps in case a researcher needs to go back and double-check the original video)
    - [ ] Add any missed words if the transcribing process missed any or to provide more context
    - [ ] Write down exactly what they say, even if it is grammatically incorrect or a topic you are not familiar with
    - [ ] If there are any typos and misidentified words in the transcript, please edit them based on what you hear in the original video because the transcribing software is not 100% accurate 
    - [ ] Delete repeated words
    - [ ] Delete non-important verbal fillers such as "um" and "uh". However, you may keep interjections like “hmm”, “uh”, “woah”, “yeah”, “ohh”, “mmm” because they often contain emotions, reactions, and meanings (e.g. Mmmm [no], Mhmm [yes])
        - For verbal filler words, see Resources # 1.04.04 for more on this topic.
        - When the verbal fillers are distractions and don't serve any purpose, you may remove them.
        - When the verbal fillers can indicate the interviewee's emotions or thoughts. In this case, keep the verbal fillers and provide context to demonstrate the emotions or thoughts. E.g., (The participant hesitated for a while before coming up with the answer).
    - [ ] Where needed, add context so that a reader can understand what was happening without watching the video. E.g., he [the mentor] was helpful; or (steps off camera).

- Read through the transcripts again and make edits to keep track of and de-identify any personally identifiable information (PII)
    - [ ] Search for the interviewee's name 
    - [ ] Replace with their participant number, i.e. Intern 001 is I001.
    - [ ] Search for interviewer or unknown speakers in the transcript
    - [ ] Replace with either UXR number or their role (i.e. notetaker) associated with the project
    - [ ] Look for any other names being mentioned by the interviewee during the interviews
    - [ ] If a person's name is mentioned, write down the name and relevant information of that individual in the `Participants List from Interviews (UXR Excluded) spreadsheet` (Resources # 2.07), and assign a participant number to them. You may need to open the spreadsheet in a new tab for easier access.  
        - Their name(s) in the transcript might be spelled wrong, so pay close attention to the original interview video. 
        - If you are not sure of the roles of any of the names mentioned, please list the names, timestamps, and transcript links in the spreadsheet, and leave the role column and the participant number column blank. Then ask Research Lead or Project Lead for clarification. 
        - Please check each participant type's abbreviation under the "Research Documents by Participant Type" section of [the Research Output Overview Wiki Page](https://github.com/hackforla/internship/wiki/Research-Output-Overview). For example, mentor is M.
        - The participant numbers are sequential based on the time of entry and occurrence of the mention. I.e. if there are already two Hack for LA website team members being listed previously in the spreadsheet, then the next Hack for LA website team member will be HfLAWTM003.
        -  If the name is already included in the sheet because other interviewees have mentioned them, please still list out their names and relevant information, and make sure to use the same role and the same participant number that has already been assigned to them so we can keep track of the people being mentioned across all interviews associated with one research plan.
        - If an interviewee repeatedly mentioned an individual throughout the interview, please list out all the timestamps when the individual was mentioned. 
        - No need to include the interviewee and the UXR names since we track them in the roll call and session table.
    - [ ] After confirming the names, roles, and other relevant information of other individuals mentioned during the interviews with the Research Lead or Project Lead, use the search and replace function in Google Doc to replace their name(s) in the transcript with the participant number assigned to them in the spreadsheet
    - [ ] Open `De-identified Participants List from Interviews (UXR Excluded) spreadsheet` (Resources # 2.04), and enter the de-identified info based on `Participants List from Interviews (UXR Excluded) spreadsheet` (Resources # 2.07), so we have de-identified info in the research plan folder in the shared Internship drive
    - [ ] Read through the transcripts to search for any other identifiable information in the interviews, such as entities, places, etc.
    - [ ] Replace any personally identifiable information (PII) with non-identifiable terms. For example, if their specific school is mentioned, we should redact that info with either [high school] or [college].
    - [ ] If they mentioned any specific issues they worked on, make sure to remove the issue numbers and rephrase the issues they worked on   

- Read through the edited transcripts again
    - [ ] Focus on punctuation, readability, and formatting
    - [ ] One recommendation is to install LanguageTool Chrome Extension (see Resources 1.05) to clean up the punctuation and verbal ticks in the transcript. But no need to correct grammatical mistakes made by interviewers and interviewees.

- When you're satisfied that the transcript is completely de-identified and cleaned up, create a new copy and save it into the shared Research folder
    - [ ] Make a new copy of the transcript by selecting "File" and "Make a copy". This is to make sure that the new version of the Google Doc does not include any editing history or PII. 
    - [ ] "Copy document" window pops up
    - [ ] In the "Name" text box, delete the "Copy of To be de-identified-" text at the beginning of the file name
    - [ ] Copy 
    ```
    De-identified Interview Transcript-
   ```
    - [ ] Paste the text you just copied to the beginning of the file name in the "Name" text box
        - The new file name should be formatted like "De-identified Interview Transcript-RP[Replace 000]-UX Researcher Abbreviation###-[Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] Abbreviation###"
