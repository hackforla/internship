### Overview
We need to transcribe RP[Replace 000]'s [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace PARTICIPANT NUMBER] [Replace TYPE OF INTERVIEW] interview recordings so that we can move on to clean up and de-identify the transcripts. 

During these tasks you will be asked to add link to the Resources/Instructions section, and that section is at the bottom of this issue (go view it now).

Another tip is to use split browser windows side by side when working on any GitHub issue, so you can edit the issue on one window, and check the resources or click through links on the other window to avoid a lot of back and forth. Make sure to refresh both windows to reflect any changes you made, including updating the issue or checking the boxes on one of them.

#### Transcribe the Interview when transcripts are not available
- [ ] Open `RP[Replace 000] Interview Recording Folder` linked in Resource # 2.04 if it is not open yet
- [ ] Check to see if [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace PARTICIPANT NUMBER]'s interview recording has been transcribed or not. If already transcribed, there should be a.txt file matching with the participant's number.
    - [ ] If yes, move on to `#### Update Interview Recordings and Transcriptions Tracking Sheet` section
    - [ ] If no, do the following to transcribe [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace PARTICIPANT NUMBER]'s interview file(s)
        - [ ] Download [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace PARTICIPANT NUMBER]'s interview recording that needs to be transcribed from the Google Drive (Resources # 2.05) to a temporary folder locally
        - [ ] Log into 1password (Resources # 1.04) to access the transcription software's account information if needed
            1. Choose internship-UI/UX vault
            1. Choose the transcription software account or the Internship-UX Google account to see login info if needed
        - [ ] Access the account by copying and pasting the login info from 1password vault
        - [ ] Confirm you can access the account you need
        - Complete the following steps using the transcription software:
            - [ ] Import or upload the video file that you need to transcribe
            - [ ] Wait for the software to transcribe the file for you
            - [ ] Once finished, download the .txt transcript file
            - [ ] Rename the .txt transcript file you downloaded in `RP[Replace 000]-UX Researcher Abbreviation###-[Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] Abbreviation###` format
                - An example looks like this: `RP006-U007-I001.txt`, which means this is an interview transcript for research plan 006, conducted by UX Researcher 007, and the interviewee is Intern 001
                - Please double-check the UX Researcher number and the participant's number in the `session table` tab of `TWE: IS[Replace YY]: RP[Replace 000]: [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] [Replace TYPE OF INTERVIEW] Interview Roll Call and Session Table` in RP[Replace 000] folder (linked in Resources # 2.02)
            - [ ] Upload the .txt file into RP[Replace 000]'s interview recording folder (Resources # 2.04)
                - So there will be two types of files named in the `RP[Replace 000]-UX Researcher Abbreviation###-[Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] Abbreviation###` format. One is a .mp4 video from the interview while the other one is a transcript in .txt format.
        - [ ] Delete the local temporary folder with recording file(s) from your own device, such as your laptop
