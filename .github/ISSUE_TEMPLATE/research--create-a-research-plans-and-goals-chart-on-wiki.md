### Overview
We need to create/update the Research Plans and Goals chart for [Replace TYPE OF PARTICIPANT] on Wiki with the research plan(s) info so we could provide a research plan overview for external use.

During these tasks you will be asked to add links to the Resources/Instructions section, and that section is at the bottom of this issue (go view it now).

Another tip is to use split browser windows side by side when working on any GitHub issue, so you can edit the issue on one window, and check the resources or click through links on the other window to avoid a lot of back and forth. Make sure to refresh both windows to reflect any changes you made, including updating the issue or checking the boxes on one of them. 

### Action Items
