## Overview

We need to get our team members familiar with GitHub and Google Drive for a better onboarding experience.

During these tasks you will be asked to refer to and/or add link to the Resources section, and that section is at the bottom of this comment (go view it now).

> While going through the action items, we need you to make new comments in this issue as practices when prompted. Please do not delete comments, but you may hide them if needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please keep track of the time you spend on each section of the issue because you need to leave comments on the time spent on each section and tally them up to update the size label of this issue once you finish all the action items.
